Problem : Analyze the data sheet to identify chains of 3-4 (or more) matching trips where cab operators are seeking and offering exchanges and then use those matches to create a full “up-down” trip for a cab operator. This means simultaneously fulfilling exchanges for multiple operators while generating a profitable, multi-leg trip for yourself (e.g., by linking their seeks/offers into a route that starts and ends beneficially for you).
